# Interactive Photo Booth for School Events
An real-time webcame interactive AI-powered photobooth for school events that captures photos, applies visual effects, and generates downloadable photostrips.

##Features
- Live Preview of your Webcam Feed
- Timed Photo Capture
- Photo Previews
- Custom Frame Color
- Effect Overlays
- AI-based Filters
- Gesture-Triggered Effects
- Photostrip Generation

##Roadmap
Pre-Project
Goal: Research on the necessary skills needed to start. (like finding tools, e.g., open source libraries, etc.)
Include…
- Find tools to possibly use, name them & explain potential uses
- Start documentation notebook
- Outline how the photobooth should look visually

Core Photobooth Functionality 
Goal: Code a reliable photobooth that behaves like a traditional booth.
Include..
- Live webcam feed using OpenCV
- Camera orientation correction
- Countdown timer before capture
- Capture a sequence of pictures
- Have the photo previews before download
- Generate photostrip (available for download)

Visual Effects & Custom Filters
Goal: Add intelligence and interaction beyond a normal photobooth. Filters, gesture signals, etc! 
Include..
- School-themed designs
- Gesture detection
- Map gestures for filters
- Filter preview before capture
- Explore computer vision techniques for face-based effects
- Apply real-time visual effects to the live camera feed
- Update README to include usage instructions

Hardware Integration 
Goal: Build a physical booth where users can use it. 
Include..
- Prepare the system for deployment on a standalone display
- Integrate external hardware components (e.g., LEDs, sensors, etc)
- Explore running the system on embedded platforms (Raspberry Pi)
- Optimize performance for real-time, public-facing use

##Project Status
The project is currently transitioning from the Pre-Project phase into Core Photobooth Functionality. I am working on using openCV to start the main photobooth functions, like accessing live-web cam feed and having the camera orientation be that of like a real photobooth (selfie mode).
